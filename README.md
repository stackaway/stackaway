👋 Hello! I'm Churnika Mundas, a passionate 3rd-year B.Tech student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai. I'm deeply enthusiastic about exploring the intersection of technology and finance, with a keen eye on the stock market. Proficient in a diverse set of languages, including JAVA, CSS, HTML, C, C++, and Python, I am currently honing my skills in Backend development, JavaScript, and AI/ML. My journey involves continuous learning and hands-on experience, with my most recent project being a front-end replication developed using CSS and HTML. Excited about the endless possibilities in the tech world, I am eager to contribute and collaborate on innovative projects. 🚀
